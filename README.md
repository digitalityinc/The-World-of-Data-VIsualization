# The World of Data Visualization

Welcome to **The World of Data Visualization**!  
This repository is a collection of tutorials, hands-on tasks, and curated readings to help students and researchers explore the power of data visualization.

## About Me
My name is **Jasmine Zhang**. Since 9th grade, I have been conducting research at the **Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania**.  

The lab I work with focuses on:
- Machine Learning  
- Medical Image Computing  
- Biomedical and Health Informatics  
- Trustworthy AI  
- NLP / LLMs  
- Network Science  
- Imaging Genomics  
- Multi-omics and Systems Biology  
- Alzheimer’s Disease Research  
- Health Disparities  
- Big Data Science in Biomedicine  

Through this experience, I’ve had the opportunity to help visualize data from multiple projects — turning complex datasets into clear and meaningful visuals that help scientists make sense of their research.  

Outside the lab, I also run the **Digital Health Club at Carmel High**, where I organize meetups on data visualization and related topics.

## Purpose of This Repository
I created this repository to **share what I’ve learned** with others who are interested in data visualization.  
It is designed to be a **learning journey**, combining theory, practice, and useful resources so that students (and anyone curious) can gain practical skills in data visualization.

## Repository Structure
This repository is organized into **9 modules**. Each module contains:
- **Tutorial slides** — to explain core concepts.  
- **Jupyter notebooks** — with hands-on tasks and coding exercises.  
- **Curated readings** — articles and papers I’ve found helpful for deeper learning.

## How to Use
1. Browse the modules in order (Module 1 → Module 9).  
2. Open the tutorial slides for conceptual learning.  
3. Work through the Jupyter notebooks to practice coding and visualization.  
4. Check out the readings for additional context and inspiration.

## Goals
- Make data visualization approachable for students and beginners.  
- Show how visualization can turn raw data into insights.  
- Inspire others to use data visualization in science, health, and beyond.
