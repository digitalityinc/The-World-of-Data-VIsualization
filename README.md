# The World of Data Visualization

Hi! 👋 I’m **Jasmine Zhang**.  

Since 9th grade, I’ve been doing research at the **Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania**, where I’ve helped scientists make sense of data through visualization. Along the way, I’ve learned how powerful charts, plots, and visuals can be for turning raw numbers into real insights.  

I also run the **Digital Health Club at Carmel High**, where I’ve hosted meetups to share ideas and projects in data visualization.

## Why This Repository?
I wanted to create a place where other students (and anyone curious!) can **learn data visualization step by step**. This repo is like a mini-course that combines what I’ve learned in research and in the classroom.  

---

## What’s Inside?
This repo has **9 modules**, and each one includes:
- 📑 Tutorial slides (to explain the concepts)  
- 💻 Jupyter notebooks (hands-on coding + practice tasks)  
- 📚 Helpful readings (articles and papers I found useful)  

---

## How to Use
1. Start with Module 1 and work your way through.  
2. Check the slides to understand the ideas.  
3. Try out the notebooks to practice coding and making visuals.  
4. Explore the readings if you want to dive deeper.

## My Goal
I want this repo to be:
- A **fun way to learn** data visualization  
- A resource to **help beginners build confidence**  
- An invitation for others to **explore, create, and share**

## Let’s Learn Together 🎨📊
I hope you enjoy this repository! Data visualization is not just about graphs — it’s about **telling stories with data**.  

Let’s make it fun, creative, and useful 🚀.
