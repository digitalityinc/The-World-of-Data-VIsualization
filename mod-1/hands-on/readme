# Module 1 – Hands-On with Python 🐍

This notebook introduces the basics of Python programming through simple examples and practice.  
It is designed as an interactive, beginner-friendly guide for students learning Python step by step.

## 📘 What’s Inside

### 1. Python Fundamentals
- **Statements & Expressions**  
- **Numbers** (integers, floats, comparisons)  
- **Strings** (text values, equality checks)  
- **Boolean Values** (True/False, logical operations)  
- **Lists and Dictionaries** (basic data structures in Python)  

### 2. Hands-On Coding
The notebook contains **live code examples** such as:
- Checking types: `type(2)`  
- Comparing values: `1 > 2`  
- Working with text: `'apple' == "apple"`  
- Using booleans: `print(3 > 2)`  
- Creating data structures: `type([1, 2, 3])`, `type((1, 2, 3))`

## 🚀 Learning Goals
By the end of this notebook, you will be able to:
- Write and run basic Python expressions.  
- Understand and use numbers, strings, and boolean values.  
- Create and manipulate simple Python data structures like lists and dictionaries.  

---

## ▶️ How to Use
1. Open the notebook in **Jupyter Notebook** or **JupyterLab**.  
2. Run each cell step by step to see the output.  
3. Experiment by changing values in the code cells.

## 🌟 Next Steps
After finishing this module, you’ll be ready to explore:
- Control flow (loops and conditionals)  
- Functions in Python  
- More complex data structures
